# Installing Hugo (binary)


`https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/`

Installation is very easy. Simply download the appropriate version for your platform. Once downloaded it can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your PATH for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

On macOS, if you have Homebrew, installation is even easier: just run brew update && brew install hugo.

On Fedora, you can install `0.19` from [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/daftaupe/hugo/
) or use this command.

```
dnf copr enable daftaupe/hugo
```


In this `bin` directory are the latest `0.19` Hugo relases for 

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
